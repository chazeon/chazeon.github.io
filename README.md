# Notes

This repo hosts my personal [homepage](docs/index.md) and [notes](docs/notes).

These notes are supposed to be built by [mkdocs][1], a Python-based static-site generator.
It is bundled with a self-crafted theme “[blanc](blanc)” and a bundle of custom-made [plugins](plugins). To build the site, install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`, then install the plugins from the `plugins` folder. Then you can run `mkdocs serve`.

The online version is being automatically built by [CloudFlare Pages][2] currently.
