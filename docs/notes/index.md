The notes hosted here are mostly derived from my own notes on [Notion](https://notion.so/).
Based on their topics, you might want to start from one of the following categories:

- Research Notes
  - [Mineral physics & geophysics](mphys)
- Course Notes
  - [Electronic & magnetic properties of solid](em-properties)
  - [Kinetics](kinetics)
  - [Linear algebra](linear-algebra)
  - [Mechanical properties of solid](mech-properties)
  - [Thermodynamics](thermodynamics)

There is also a [tree](tree) that lists all the notes.

I also have a [about](about) page and a [quote](quote) page that you might find interesting.
