title: Projection operator

The projection operator $\hat P$ for a vector is

$$ \hat P = \frac{aa^T}{a^Ta} $$

Or $p = \hat x = \hat Pb = [a^Tb / (a^Ta)]a$

â‡’ Generally, if the set of column vectors $\{a_i\}$ of $A$ is all orthogonal we have the [Least square fitting](https://www.notion.so/Least-square-fitting-902e15b5970942eaa49c663b42ad907e).
