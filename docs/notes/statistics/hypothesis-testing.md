Given a limited number of samples, see *how likely* the hypothesis are true. Both Z test and t test aims to convert the sample statistics to overall statistics.

## Definitions

### Z test

$$
Z = \frac{\bar X - \mu_0}{s}
$$

### t-test

$$
t = \frac{\bar X - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
$$

### Comparison
