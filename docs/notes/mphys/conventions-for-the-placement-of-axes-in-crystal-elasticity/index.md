title: Conventions for the placement of axes in crystal elasticity
---

A good reference for the symmetry relation in the fourth-rank elasticity tensor ($C_{ijkl}$) components is Brugger (1965), but it relies on a specific placement of Cartesian axes, which is unclear in the paper. A standard for the placement, though seems implicit now, is known by the ultrasound community, exists elsewhere.

R. N. Thurston (Truesdell, 1984):

> By material coefficients, we here mean derivatives of a thermodynamic potential, evaluated at some generalized undistorted, zero-field state. In the simplest case, the only nonzero first derivative of any thermodynamic potential is its derivative with respect to the thermal variable, either temperature or entropy. A hydrostatic pressure at the undistorted state is permissible [cf. Sect. 11.4, especially Eq. (11.35)].
>
>  The elastic, dielectric, piezoelectric, and other coefficients of crystals are ordinarily specified with reference to a set of rectangular Cartesian axes that are chosen by convention. The conventional method of relating a set of rectangular axes to the crystallographic axes has been standardized through the work of Bond (1949) and others, and is described in publications of Mason ({--1950--}{++1947++}, 1966).

The original text in the book mistakenly refers to Mason (1950) instead of Mason (1947). The Bond (1949) one is a IRE (now IEEE) standard, the placement seems to be clear only in the 1949 version but not in more recent versions. Mason (1947) is a paper and should be quite easy to find; Mason (1966) is a book that seems to be difficult to find[^1].

A more recent reference is [The AFLOW standard encyclopedia of crystallographic prototypes](http://www.aflowlib.org/prototype-encyclopedia/) and its three relevant papers: Mehl et al., (2017), Hicks et al., (2019, 2021).
