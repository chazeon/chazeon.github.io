title: Semiclassical (band theory) conductivity
---

The following properties from band theory will be plugged into [[Drude model for conductivity]]

$$ \sigma = \frac{ne^2\tau}{m^*} $$

to provide a semiclassical estimation of conductivity.

Group velocity

$$ v_\text{g} = \frac{1}{\hbar}\left(\frac{\partial E(k)}{\partial k}\right) $$

Effective mass $m^*$

$$ m^*= \hbar^2\left(\frac{\partial^2E(k)}{\partial k^2}\right)^{-1} $$

Or simply can be thought of as a second-order expansion of Hamiltonian ($H = \hbar^2k^2/2m + V(r)$) near $k=0$.
