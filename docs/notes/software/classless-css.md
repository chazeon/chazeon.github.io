title: Classless CSS
---

Classless CSS are *drop-in* stylesheets that can be applied to the websites without much pain. These are faster and better bootstrap styles when create a new indie website than the actual Bootstrap framework.

Here are some good ones that I would like to recommended:

- [OK.css](https://okcss.netlify.app/) 
- [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/)
- [awsm.css](https://igoradamenko.github.io/awsm.css/)
