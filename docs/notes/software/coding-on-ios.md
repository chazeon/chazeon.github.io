## SSH Tools

- [Blink](https://blink.sh) (via [GitHub](https://github.com/blinksh/blink), [AppStore](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id1594898306)) - Command-line native SSH tools on iOS, great iCloud sync feature.
- [Rayon](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rayon-ssh-server-toolbox/id1609781496) - Great snippets tool, which is command-centric instead of machine-centric.
- [Secure ShellFish](https://secureshellfish.app) (via [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/secure-shellfish/id1336634154)) - It originates as an SFTP extension to the Files app. Right now it also supports terminal access. However, these functionalities are also supported by Blink now.
