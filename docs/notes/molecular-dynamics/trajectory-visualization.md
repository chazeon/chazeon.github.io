title: MD Trajectory Visualization
---

- [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/) is a good option for MD trajectory visualization. However, it requires the paid tier to enable Python automization and good render engines.
- In comparison, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) is not a bad option considering it has full Python support out-of-box.
