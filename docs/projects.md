I love using, tweaking, and creating tools. Below is an indefinite list of tools that I have created.

## Docsets

The docsets works with [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) and [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/). They are API docs scraped from the official websites, but when stored on your hardrives they are faster to load and equipped with fancier navigations. Since few from the quamtum chemistry community seems to care about it enough to prepare these for me, I decided to create them my self:

- [VASP Docsets](https://github.com/chazeon/vasp-docset)
- [QE Docsets](https://github.com/chazeon/qe-docset)
